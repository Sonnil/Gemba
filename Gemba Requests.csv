At this point the distribution pump also shut off since thank was empty within few munities. WE investigated all the labs for leaks and possible POUs left open and could not find the cause. At around 1:30am , We found the drain valve switch was left open instead of auto position . This turn out to be the cause of the low level alarm . Switch turn off and system is running normal.

The skid ran without further alarms but the meter itself had an alarm/error message on it that read “ch1Error pH offset too high”. Automation and MSAT consulted.
